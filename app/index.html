      <h1>Why?</h1>
      <p>Currently we rent an apartment in Charlottenlund, but we would like to move closer to the city center.</p>

      <h1 id="hello">What?</h1>
      <p>We are looking for a <strong>small or medium</strong> sized apartment (40 - 100 sqm). Our budget can stretch according to the location, size and condition but we would like to keep the rent below 10.000 kr. per month. </p>

      <p>We have been renting furnished apartments since we moved here, so we won't bring a whole lot with us. That means we can rent flats <strong>both with and without furniture</strong>. </p>

      <h1 id="hello">When?</h1>

      <p>We are primarily looking for a <strong>long term contract</strong> i.e. at least one year and perhaps more. We are very flexible in terms of starting date.</p>
      
      <h1 id="hello">Where?</h1>
      <p>We have been living in northern Copenhagen for the last 3 years and we love it. We would really like to move to an apartment in a place like <strong>Østerbro</strong> or <strong>Nordhavn</strong> but we would be also happy to live in <strong>Central Copenhagen</strong>, <strong>Frederiksberg</strong>, <strong>Nørrebro</strong> or <strong>Vesterbro</strong>.</p>
